          This wild curiosity drove me to take some of the most advanced mathematics and  science classes during my years of schooling. Then in my senior year, I was introduced to a whole new world when I took my first Computer Science course. From that moment, I realized the power of computers and software, and I knew I wanted to be a part of this in some way.

          When I think about my life and how I want to be remembered, one major thing I want people to say about me is that I solved real problems that stayed solved. At the end of the day, writing code and geeking out over the latest technologies is nothing more than a hobby if I do not leverage this skill and technology to solve important world problems.
